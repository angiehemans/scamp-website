# Terminal

Scamp includes a built-in terminal, so you can run commands without
leaving the app.

## Open the terminal

To show or hide the terminal panel, press **Ctrl+`** (backtick), or
click the terminal icon on the right of the canvas toolbar.

## Use the terminal

The terminal opens in your project directory. Use it to do the
following:

- Run AI agents or command-line tools. See
  [Work with AI agents](ai-agents.md).
- Run git commands.

## The MCP indicator

When a project is open, the panel header shows an **MCP** pill. Its dot
tells you whether Scamp's [MCP server](ai-agents.md) is running and
whether an agent is connected; its tooltip lists the agent
configurations that Scamp registered. For the meaning of each color, see
[Is it working?](ai-agents.md#is-it-working).

The copy button beside the pill copies a connect command to your
clipboard, for agents that Scamp can't configure automatically (VS Code
and Codex), or for a session that was already running when you opened
the project.

## Multiple tabs

You can open up to three terminal tabs. Each tab runs an independent
shell session, so you can run a dev server in one tab and an agent in
another.

## Persistence

The terminal keeps running while the panel is hidden. Hide the panel
with **Ctrl+`**, and your processes continue in the background. Reopen
the panel to see their output.

## Error recovery

If a terminal fails to start—for example, because of a shell
configuration issue—Scamp tries to recover automatically. If the
problem persists, close the tab and open a new one.
